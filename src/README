How to use:

./FedoraFs.py /path/to/mountpoint

Can also specify fedora connection options: host, port, username, password, version
These are all listed in the fuse help you see when you run ./FedoraFs.py -h

Example usage:
./FedoraFs.py -o base_url=http://fedora.server.edu:8080/fedora -o username=login -o password= fedora/

If password is specified but blank, you will be prompted to enter a password.

To unmount:
  fusermount -u fedora/

Use -d when in development to see fuse debugging output, error messages, etc.

current status of implementation:

  directory structure:
    pid		(object treated as directory)
        .info (top-level properties)
	datastreams
	dissemination methods
	relations to other fedora objects (directory) 
	   pid (symlink to top-level object)
 	.versions  
	   datetime (one for each revision in object history)
		.info (top-level properties - but not actually versioned?)
		datastreams as of datetime

 - creation/modification time set for top-level of object but little else
   - modification time for all versioned inferred from datetime in path
 - no caching implemented yet; working with large datastreams is very
   inefficient and slow

prerequisites:

 - FUSE kernel module (or other OS support)
 - Python FUSE support (python-fuse)
 - eulfedora
