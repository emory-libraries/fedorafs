howto use:

./FedoraFs.py /path/to/mountpoint

 can also specify fedora connection options: host, port, username, password, version
 these are all listed in the fuse help you see when you run ./FedoraFs.py -h

current status of implementation:
 - fedora server/port/username all hard-coded
 - contents of top-level directory are based on pids found if
   findObjects is working  (falls back to hard-coded list of pids used for testing)

  directory structure:
    pid		(object treated as directory)
        .info (top-level properties)
	datastreams
	dissemination methods
	relations to other fedora objects (directory)
	   pid (symlink to top-level object)

 - creation/modification time set for top-level of object but nothing else
 - no caching implemented yet; filesize etc. is very inefficient and slow, 
   esp. for objects with large datastreams

 - currently only using REST interface and probably only works for Fedora 2.2
 - relations to other objects requires risearch 


prerequisites:

 - FUSE kernel module (or other OS support)
 - Python FUSE support (python-fuse)
 - Python Zolera Soap Infrastructure (python-zsi)
 - Python ElementTree (easy_install ElementTree)
