howto use:

./FedoraFs.py /path/to/mountpoint


current status of implementation:
 - fedora server/port/username all hard-coded
 - initial list of pids is hard-coded

  directory structure:
    pid		(object treated as directory)
        .info (top-level properties)
	datastreams
	dissemination methods

 - creation/modification time set for top-level of object but nothing else
 - no caching implemented yet; filesize etc. is very inefficient and slow, 
   esp. for objects with large datastreams

 - currently only using REST interface and probably only works for Fedora 2.2
